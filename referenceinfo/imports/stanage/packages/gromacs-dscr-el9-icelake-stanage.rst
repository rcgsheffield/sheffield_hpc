GROMACS is a versatile package to perform molecular dynamics, i.e. simulate the
Newtonian equations of motion for systems with hundreds to millions of
particles.

This is a CPU only build, containing both MPI and threadMPI builds
for both single and double precision.

It also contains the gmxapi extension for the single precision MPI build.
