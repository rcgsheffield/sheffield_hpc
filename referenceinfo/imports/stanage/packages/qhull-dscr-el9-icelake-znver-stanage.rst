Qhull computes the convex hull, Delaunay triangulation, Voronoi diagram,
halfspace intersection about a point, furthest-site Delaunay triangulation,
and furthest-site Voronoi diagram. The source code runs in 2-d, 3-d, 4-d, and
higher dimensions. Qhull implements the Quickhull algorithm for computing the
convex hull.
