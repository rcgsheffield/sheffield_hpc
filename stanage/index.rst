.. note::

    The latest changes and newly installed software on our clusters can be found on the `HPC Changelog <http://changelog.hpc.shef.ac.uk/>`_ microsite.


This is the documentation for Stanage, the University of Sheffield's new High Performance Computing cluster. Stanage is the logical successor to the :ref:`sharc` cluster featuring 
more modern CPUs with significantly greater numbers of cores available.

.. caution:: 
    It is highly recommended that users read the :ref:`stanage-FAQ-gotchas` and :ref:`stanage-totp-setup` pages as these contain vital information for users new to the cluster. 
    
    In particular, first time connecting     users struggling to connect should ensure they fully read the :ref:`steps to setup and connect with TOTP multifactor authentication <stanage-totp-setup>`.
