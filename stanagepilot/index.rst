Welcome to the Stanage Cluster Pilot User Guide. This section contains the instructions and information that
pilot users will need to best make use of the Stanage cluster during the pilot phase.

These instructions and information have been structured into the sections below. Please review all of this material
as there are several important limitations and gotchas that could surprise you.

As this is an early access phase please be aware that the cluster configuration, enabled features and
available software is subject to change.

There may be bugs or issues so please let us know if you encounter any issues
at `research-it@sheffield.ac.uk <mailto:research-it@sheffield.ac.uk?subject=Stanage Pilot Feedback>`_ .
