R was compiled from source using gcc 4.4.7 and the following commands::

        $ qrsh -l rmem=8G mem=16G
        $ tar -xvzf ./R-3.2.1.tar.gz
        $ cd R-3.2.1

The standard amount of memory allocated for a qrsh session was insufficient to build R, which is why 8gig was requested instead. ::

        $ module load libs/gcc/lapack
        $ module load libs/gcc/blas
        $ ./configure --prefix /usr/local/packages6/R/3.2.1 --with-blas --with-lapack --enable-R-shlib

output from the ``configure`` step was ::
