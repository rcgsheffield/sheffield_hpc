Interactive Usage
-----------------
After connecting to sharc (see :ref:`ssh`),  start an interactive session with the :ref:`qrshx` command.

The latest version of Maple (currently 2022) is made available with the command ::

        module load apps/maple

Alternatively, you can load a specific version with ::

        module load apps/maple/2022/binary
        module load apps/maple/2018/binary

You can then run the graphical version of Maple by entering ``xmaple`` or the command line version by entering ``maple``.

Batch usage
-----------
It is not possible to run Maple worksheets in batch mode. Instead, you must convert your worksheet to a pure text file that contains a set of maple input commands. You can do this in Maple by opening your worksheet and clicking on **File->Export As->Maple Input**. The result will have the file extension .mpl

An example Sun Grid Engine submission script that makes use of a .mpl file called, for example, **mycode.mpl** is ::

    #!/bin/bash
    # Request 4 gigabytes of real memory
    #$ -l rmem=4G

    module load apps/maple/2022

    maple < mycode.mpl

For general information on how to submit batch jobs refer to :ref:`submit_batch_sharc`.
