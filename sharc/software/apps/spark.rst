.. sidebar:: Spark

   :Version: 2.1
   :URL: http://spark.apache.org/

Apache Spark is a fast and general engine for large-scale data processing.

Interactive Usage
-----------------
After connecting to Sharc (see :ref:`ssh`),  start an interactive session with the :ref:`qrsh` or :ref:`qrshx` command.

Before using Spark, you will need to load a version of Java. For example ::

    module load apps/java/jdk1.8.0_102/binary

To make Spark available, use the following module command ::

    module load apps/spark/2.1.0/gcc-4.8.5

You can now start a Spark shell session with ::

    spark-shell

SparkR
------
To use SparkR, you will additionally need to load a version of R ::

    module load apps/java/jdk1.8.0_102/binary
    module load apps/spark/2.1.0/gcc-4.8.5
    module load apps/R/3.3.2/gcc-4.8.5

Now you can start a SparkR session ::

  sparkR

Setting the number of cores
---------------------------
The installation of Spark on Sharc is limited to jobs that make use of one node.
As such, the maximum number of CPU cores you can request for a Spark job is limited to 16 cores.

First, you must request cores from the scheduler.
That is, you add the following line to your submission script to request 4 cores ::

  #$ -pe smp 4

You must also tell Spark to only use 4 cores by setting the `MASTER` environment variable ::

  export MASTER=local[4]

A full example is given at https://github.com/mikecroucher/HPC_Examples/tree/master/languages/Python/pyspark_pi

Installation notes
------------------
These notes are primarily for administrators of the system.

**Version 2.1**

Spark 2.1 was built using the system gcc 4.8.5 ::

    qrsh -l rmem=10G

    module load apps/java/jdk1.8.0_102/binary
    export MAVEN_OPTS="-Xmx2g -XX:ReservedCodeCacheSize=512m"
    tar -xvzf ./spark-2.1.0.tgz
    cd spark-2.1.0
    ./build/mvn -DskipTests clean package

    mkdir -p /usr/local/packages/apps/spark/2.1
    cd ..
    mv spark-2.1.0 /usr/local/packages/apps/spark/2.1

The default install of Spark is incredibly verbose. Even a 'Hello World' program results in many lines of ``[INFO]``.
To make it a little quieter, the default log4j level has been reduced from ``INFO`` to ``WARN``: ::

    cd /usr/local/packages/apps/spark/2.1/spark-2.1.0/conf/
    cp log4j.properties.template log4j.properties

The file ``log4j.properties`` was then edited so that the line beginning ``log4j.rootCategory`` reads: ::

     log4j.rootCategory=WARN, console

Modulefile
----------

**Version 2.1**

The following module file is on the system at ``/usr/local/modulefiles/apps/spark/2.1.0/gcc-4.8.5`` ::
