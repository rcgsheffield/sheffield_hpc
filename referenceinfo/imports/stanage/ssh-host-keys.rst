If you are connecting for the first time on your current device, before you enter any details, you should make sure that the SSH 'fingerprint' is correct.
The RSA, ECDSA and ED25519 fingerprints for Stanage's login nodes are: ::

    SHA256:mFfJmZHH0SUogoUhTtlatoZLEacfGAlj0cTrnInO5z0 (RSA)
    SHA256:4HdvK3C1KDm+JG1TzxQKxezMz5ojEORynHUqF9tQfoI (ECDSA)
    SHA256:aaTv+0TEc0nj7WR2ZuBYWFDD+QqzOKJpMjEFKBx6pQU (ED25519)

Your SSH client will show one of these fingerprints by default. If any one of these fingerprints matches you should continue. 

.. warning::

    If none of these fingerprints matches the fingerprint shown in your terminal please
