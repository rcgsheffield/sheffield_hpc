This is the manual for all the High Performance Computing (HPC) services
provided at the University of Sheffield.

High Performance Computing at Sheffield
---------------------------------------

The Research Computing Group manages two High Performance Computing (HPC)
systems at Sheffield, the **iceberg** cluster and the new **ShARC** cluster.
These systems are going to both be available for the next few years, however,
eventually iceberg will be retired. For all the information on the two clusters
see:

:ref:`iceberg`

:ref:`sharc`

Both the clusters are designed to be similar enough to one another so that if
you are familiar with one you will be able to use both. It will be possible to
access data stored in some data stores from both clusters. Both clusters will
not have the same applications and libraries installed on them, however, any
missing software can be requested. For more information on the software
available on the two clusters see the links below:

:ref:`iceberg-software`

:ref:`sharc-software`

Research Computing Team
-----------------------

The research computing team are the team responsible for the iceberg service, as well as all other aspects of research computing.
If you require support with iceberg, training or software for your workstations, the research computing team would be happy to help.
Take a look at the `Research Computing <https://www.shef.ac.uk/cics/research>`_ website or email `research-it@sheffield.ac.uk <research-it@sheffield.ac.uk>`_.
