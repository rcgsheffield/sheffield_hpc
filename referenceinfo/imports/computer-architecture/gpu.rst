GPU
---

 A graphical processing unit (GPU) is the second most common processing unit in a computer which is designed to perform specific graphical calculations very quickly and is normally used to drive a computer's displays. 
 These are commonly connected via a PCIe slot and bus. More recently GPUs have been used to perform similar graphical calculations but for other purposes such as AI or machine learning.
