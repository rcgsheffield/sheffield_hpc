Git Large File Storage (LFS) replaces large files such as audio
samples, videos, datasets, and graphics with text pointers inside Git, while 
storing the file contents on a remote server like GitHub.com

Interactive Usage
-----------------

.. include:: /referenceinfo/imports/scheduler/SLURM/common_commands/srun_start_interactive_session_import_stanage.rst

The latest version of |softwarename| is made available with the command:

.. code-block:: console
        
    module load git-lfs

You can now run the ``git lfs`` command:

Examples
--------

To get started with Git LFS, the following commands can be used.


Choose the type of files you want to track, for examples all ISO
images, with git lfs track:

.. code-block:: 

    git lfs track "*.iso"

The above stores this information in gitattributes files, so that
file needs to be added to the repository:

.. code-block:: 

    git add .gitattributes

Commit, push and work with the files normally:

.. code-block:: 

    git add file.iso
    git commit -m "Add disk image"
    git push
