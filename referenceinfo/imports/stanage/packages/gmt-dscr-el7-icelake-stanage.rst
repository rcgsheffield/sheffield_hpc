GMT is an open source collection of about 80 command-line tools for manipulating
geographic and Cartesian data sets (including filtering, trend fitting, gridding, projecting,
etc.) and producing PostScript illustrations ranging from simple x-y plots via contour maps
to artificially illuminated surfaces and 3D perspective views; the GMT supplements add another
40 more specialized and discipline-specific tools.
