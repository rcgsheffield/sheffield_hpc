HPC Documentation
-----------------

The HPC documentation we provide (this website) is regularly updated and contains a large amount of info about using our 
HPC clusters. Users should at minimum ensure they have read through the :ref:`getting-started` section as it contains a 
concise summary of relevant information required to start using our HPC clusters efficiently and optimally.

------

General HPC Problems
--------------------

If you are struggling to get something working on the HPC you should first have a look through our documentation on the technology (e.g. :ref:`parallel_MPI`), 
software (e.g. :ref:`stanage-software` ) or cluster (e.g. :ref:`Bessemer`) you are using to see if we have already installed the software / addressed your problem.

You should also make sure you look through our :ref:`FAQs` section as it covers many common mistakes. If you are having issues with your jobs failing 
please have a look through the section on :ref:`job debugging on the Stanage and Bessemer <job_debugging_bessemer>` clusters.

.. note::

    Please make sure you check through our resources prior to contacting us as we are a small team with limited resources.

If you are still having issues or need specific advice e.g. how to best parallelise your workflow, please contact 
`IT Services' Research and Innovation team <mailto:research-it@sheffield.ac.uk>`_ or if you have more specific queries about programming / coding for HPC clusters e.g. CUDA programming please contact
the `Research Software Engineering team <https://rse.shef.ac.uk/contact/>`_.

HPC training?
-------------

IT Services' Research and Innovation courses
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are new to the cluster, have never used Linux or HPC before you should attend the RIT 101 (Introduction to Linux)
and RIT 102 (High-Performance Computing) courses.

These courses are very popular and run through both semesters. You can find details and how to register at the website: https://sites.google.com/sheffield.ac.uk/research-training/ (Only accessible with the VPN turned on.)

IT Services' Research and Innovation training index
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `Research and Innovation team's training index <https://rcgsheffield.github.io/TUoS-RIT-training-resources/training.html>`__ 
allows you to search for internal (to TUoS) and external training resources 
covering categories including HPC, Data Analysis / Visualisation, containerisation as well as domain specific resources such as 
FEA, CFD, Chemistry and more.

This site is currently in beta and more links are resources are being added.
