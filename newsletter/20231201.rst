News - 2023-12-22
=================

Welcome to the first edition of our monthly newsletter where we plan to update you on upcoming news and also showcase the great work happening on our HPC. As we break for the end year holidays we can only reflect on the challenges we came across here at Research Innovation IT. We launched Stanage, said goodbye to our old friend ShARC and supported our HPC users. Thank you for a great 2023 and we look forward to supporting you all innovate in 2024. The team will be away for the festive period from the 23/12/2023 to 2/1/2024 inclusive. Happy holidays everyone.  

ShARC Decommissioned
---------------------
- As of November 30th, we have officially decommissioned our oldest High-Performance Computing (HPC) cluster, ShARC. For reference, we have archived ShARC's documentation :ref:`here <decommissioned>`.  
- Support remains available for users needing assistance transitioning to Stanage and Bessemer. You can access support through 
	- The `courses <https://sites.google.com/sheffield.ac.uk/research-training/>`_ we offer 
	- Join our drop-in sessions by signing up through the Google Form included in our weekly email that advertises these sessions.
	- Or by reaching out via email to ``researchcomputing@sheffield.ac.uk``  with your query. 
- A huge thanks to the members of the team who contributed towards its creation in the early days and for the ones who saw it through to its decommissioning. We plan to ship it to the `Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute` in Kyiv, so that it can have a second life supporting researchers.

GPU Benchmarks
--------------
- At the beginning of the academic year, we benchmarked the performance of NVIDIA H100 GPUs on Stanage and shared our discoveries, available `here <https://notesrcg.blogspot.com/2023/08/Stanage-HPC-new-h100-gpus-available-benchmarking.html>`_ . Our findings highlighted how different workloads benefit from different GPUs. This led us to more recently investigating NVIDIA L40 GPUs as a potential addition to our GPU offerings. Our colleagues, Farhad Allian and Peter Heywood, detailed their findings in the following `blog post <https://notesrcg.blogspot.com/2023/12/blog-post.html>`_ in November. 

Recent HPC documentation updates:
---------------------------------
- :ref:`Graphical user interface sessions on Stanage <flight-desktop>`
- The ShARC documentation section has been moved to the :ref:`Decommissioned Clusters <decommissioned>` section.
- Job completion emails contain limited job efficiency information, displaying job status with :ref:`seff  <seff>` gives more detail. Please make use of these to optimise your resource request.
