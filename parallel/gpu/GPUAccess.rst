.. _GPUAccess:

Requesting access to GPU facilities
-----------------------------------
In order to ensure that the nodes hosting the GPUs run only GPU related tasks, we have defined a special project-group for accessing these nodes. If you wish to take advantage of the GPU processors, please contact research-it@sheffield.ac.uk asking to join the GPU project group.

Any iceberg user can apply to join this group. However, because our GPU resources are limited we will need to discuss the needs of the user and obtain consent from the project leader before allowing usage.
