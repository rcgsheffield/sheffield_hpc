Contributing
=============

If you are working on a PR  here is a possible checklist of tasks to complete:

* Identify the scope and purpose of the documentation. What topics will be covered, and what level of detail is required? Consider consulting with other contributors or users to gather feedback and ensure that the documentation meets their needs.

* Create a new branch or fork of the codebase to make your changes. Make sure to name the branch or fork appropriately to reflect the purpose of the changes.

* Write the documentation in a clear, concise, and consistent style. Use headings, lists, and other formatting tools to make the information easy to read and understand. Consider including screenshots or diagrams to illustrate complex concepts.

* Test the documentation to ensure that it is accurate and up-to-date. Try following the instructions yourself to see if they are clear and complete. Consider asking other contributors or users to review the documentation and provide feedback.

* Add the documentation to the appropriate location in the codebase. Make sure to use the correct file format (e.g., Markdown, reStructuredText) and to follow any existing conventions for organizing documentation.

* Add links to the documentation from relevant parts of the site, such as the admin dashboard or help pages. Make sure that the links are clear and easy to find.

* Update any relevant documentation indexes or tables of contents to include the new documentation.

* Update the README or other project documentation to reflect the changes you have made.

* Create a pull request on GitHub and describe the changes you have made in the PR description. Be sure to reference any issues or discussion threads that are related to the changes.

* Monitor the PR for feedback and address any issues or concerns raised by other contributors.

* Once the changes have been reviewed and approved, merge the PR into the main codebase.
