   :Version: 5.4.1,5.4.4
   :Dependencies: Fortran and C compilers, an implementation of MPI, numerical libraries BLAS, LAPACK, ScaLAPACK, FFTW. Modules for Intel compiler 2019.5.281, Intel MPI 2019.5.281 and Intel MKL 2019b loaded.

The Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) is a computer program for atomic scale materials modelling, e.g. electronic structure calculations and quantum-mechanical molecular dynamics, from first principles.


Usage
-----

VASP 5.4.1 or 5.4.4 can be activated using one of the module load commands below: ::

    module load VASP/5.4.1-intel-2019b
    module load VASP/5.4.4-intel-2019b

The VASP executables are ``vasp_std``, ``vasp_gam`` and ``vasp_ncl``.

.. important::

    Only licensed users of VASP are entitled to use the code; refer to VASP's website for license details: https://www.vasp.at/registration_form/ . Access to VASP on Bessemer is restricted to members of the unix group ``hpc_vasp``.
    To be added to this group, please contact ``research-it@sheffield.ac.uk`` and provide evidence of your eligibility to use VASP.


Pseudopotential files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

VASP Pseudopotentials can be found in the ``$VASP_ROOT`` directory in versioned ``potpaw`` sub-directories after loading the module, e.g. :

.. code-block:: console

    $ module load VASP/5.4.1-intel-2019b
    $ ls $VASP_ROOT
    bin  easybuild  potpaw_LDA  potpaw_PBE

Batch jobs
----------

Users are encouraged to write their own batch submission scripts. The following is an example batch submission script, ``my_job.sh``, to run ``vasp_std`` and which is submitted to the queue with the command ``sbatch my_job.sh``. ::

    #!/bin/bash
    #SBATCH --nodes=1
    #SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=4
    #SBATCH --mem=4000
    #SBATCH --time 00:30:00
    #SBATCH --job-name=VASPTEST
    #SBATCH --output=VASPTEST.job
    #SBATCH --mail-user=username@sheffield.ac.uk
    #SBATCH --mail-type=ALL

    module load VASP/5.4.4-intel-2019b
    srun --export=ALL vasp_std

The script requests 4 cores using  Intel MPI with a runtime of 30 mins and 4 GB of real memory.


Installation notes
------------------


VASP 5.4.1 and 5.4.4 were installed using Easybuild, build details can be found in ``/usr/local/packages/live/eb/VASP/5.4.1-intel-2019b/easybuild`` and ``/usr/local/packages/live/eb/VASP/5.4.4-intel-2019b/easybuild``

Module files have been modified to include the VASP Pseudopotentials directory environment variables. Installations have also been modified and had
correctly versioned Pseudopotentials folders symlinked into their ``$VASP_ROOT`` directory from the main Pseudopotentials storage directory as indicated by ``$PSEUDOPOTENTIAL_DIR``.

VASP Pseudopotential files downloaded from the VASP portal and/or license holders can provide future versions as these are provided under the same license as the program.

The module files are:

* :download:`/usr/local/modulefiles/live/eb/all/VASP/5.4.1-intel-2019b </bessemer/software/modulefiles/VASP/5.4.1/5.4.1-intel-2019b>`.
* :download:`/usr/local/modulefiles/live/eb/all/VASP/5.4.4-intel-2019b </bessemer/software/modulefiles/VASP/5.4.4/5.4.4-intel-2019b>`.

These installations were tested by running a batch job using the ``my_job.sh`` batch script above with the input for the "O atom" example (https://www.vasp.at/wiki/index.php/O_atom) from the online VASP tutorials (https://www.vasp.at/wiki/index.php/Category:Tutorials).
