GPU nodes (Computer Science)
============================

GPU nodes purchased for :ref:`Bessemer <bessemer>` by the `Department of Computer Science <https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs>`__ (DCS)
for use by DCS research staff, their collaborators and their research students.

Hardware specifications
-----------------------

Eight nodes (``bessemer-node030`` to ``bessemer-node037``) each have:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 0

   * - Processors
     - 2x Intel Xeon Gold 6138 (2.00GHz; 20 cores per CPU)
   * - RAM
     - 192GB (DDR4 @ 2666 MHz)
   * - NUMA nodes
     - 2x
   * - GPUS
     - 4x NVIDIA Tesla V100 SXM2 (32GB RAM each; NVLINK interconnects between GPUs)
   * - Networking
     - 25 Gbps Ethernet
   * - Local storage
     - 140 GB of temporary storage under ``/scratch`` (2x SSD RAID1)

Requesting Access
-----------------

Access to the node is managed by the `RSE team <https://rse.shef.ac.uk>`_. Access policy:

* PhD students, researchers and staff in Computer Science can all request access to the nodes.
* Access to others who are collaborating on projects with some Computer Science / RSE involvement
  can be made on a case-by-case basis.
* Access to Computer Science MSc and BSc students
  can be made on a case-by-case basis.

A number of other users were granted access before this policy was developed.

To request access complete `this Google Form <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfIT2mqAw3l3HAqTJ3HsThiaKT7HYb04MqyLST9vYARspRO6A/viewform?usp=sf_link>`__
and someone within the RSE team will then respond with further information.

Using the nodes
---------------

There are several ways to access these nodes.
The type of access granted for a job depends on which Slurm *Account* and *Partition* are requested at job submission time.

1. DCS test/debugging access
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

E.g. for short test batch jobs or for interactive debugging.

To submit a job via this route, you need to :ref:`specify a *Partition* and *Account* <slurm_access_priv_nodes>` when submitting a batch job or starting an interactive session:

* Partition: ``dcs-gpu-test``
* Account: ``dcs-res`` (members of DCS) or ``dcs-collab`` (collaborators of DCS)
* QoS: do not specify one i.e. do not use the ``--qos`` parameter.

Resource limits per job:

* Exactly 1 or 2 GPUs must be requested
* Default run-time: 30 minutes
* Maximum run-time: 30 minutes
* :ref:`Number of CPU cores, amount of RAM and number of GPUs in a single node <dcs_gpu_nodes_hw>`
  i.e. multi-node jobs are not permitted.

Each user can run a maximum of two of these jobs concurrently.

2. DCS access for larger jobs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you want to run a longer job that uses up to *all* the resources available in *one* of these nodes
then you can :ref:`specify a different Partition <slurm_access_priv_nodes>` when submitting a batch job or starting an interactive session:

* Partition: ``dcs-gpu``
* Account: ``dcs-res`` (members of DCS) or ``dcs-collab`` (collaborators of DCS)
* QoS: do not specify one i.e. do not use the ``--qos`` parameter.

Please *only run batch jobs this way*: long-running interactive sessions that are associated with large resource requests are often an inefficient way of using cluster resources.

Resource limits per job:

* At least one GPU must be requested
* Default run-time: 8 hours
* Maximum run-time: 7 days
* :ref:`Number of CPU cores, amount of RAM and number of GPUs in a single node <dcs_gpu_nodes_hw>`
  i.e. multi-node jobs are not permitted.

   If using cluster-wide values for default and max run time then link to central info re that rather than duplicating here.

   Leave commented until implemented and tested

   3. General preemptable access

   Users other than Computer Science researchers and their collaborators can
   make use of idle time on these nodes and other nodes
   for running GPU jobs *or* CPU-only jobs
   by submitting batch jobs and starting interactive sessions :ref:`specifying a particular partition <slurm_access_priv_nodes>`:

   * Partition: ``preempt``

   These jobs can be preempted by jobs submitted to the ``dcs-gpu`` and ``dcs-gpu-test`` partitions;
   if this happens
   the preempted jobs will be stopped mid-execution and re-queued.
