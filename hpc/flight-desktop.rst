Graphical sessions on Stanage
=============================

Graphical desktop access to an interactive session can be achieved using Flight Desktop and TigerVNC. See below for simple usage instructions.

Usage instructions
------------------

Download and install `TigerVNC <http://sourceforge.net/projects/tigervnc/>`_ on your machine.  TigerVNC is a program that allows you to efficiently view graphical programs on one computer that are actually running on another computer.

.. tip::

    You may wish to consider requesting more resources for your session, please see :ref:`requesting an interactive session on slurm <submit_interactive_stanage>`  

Initialise and start Flight Desktop:

.. code-block:: bash

    flight start # Start the Flight environment to enable further Flight commands
    flight desktop verify xfce   # only do this once
    flight desktop start --geometry 1800x1000 xfce
    
The following is example output, in case of error please see :ref:`trouble shooting<trouble_flight>`:

.. code-block:: console
  :emphasize-lines: 22

    Starting a 'xfce' desktop session:

   âœ… Starting session 

    A 'xfce' desktop session has been started.

    == Session details ==

      Identity: 8db560e9-d56e-4776-81d2-037c690279bc
          Type: xfce
       Host IP: 10.10.1.1
      Hostname: node001
          Port: 5911
       Display: :11
      Password: l7IdD9I0

    This desktop session is not directly accessible from outside of your
    cluster as it is running on a machine that only provides internal
    cluster access.  In order to access your desktop session you will need
    to perform port forwarding using 'ssh'.

    Refer to 'flight desktop show 8db561e9' for more details.

    If prompted, you should supply the following password: l7IdE9I0

Get details of the desktop session using the command provided in the previous output:

.. code-block::

    flight desktop show xxxx  # xxxx = session number

The following is example output:

.. code-block:: console
  :emphasize-lines: 7,16,30

        == Session details ==

      Identity: 8db560e9-d56e-4776-81d2-037c690269bc
          Type: xfce
      Host IP: 10.10.1.1
      Hostname: node001
          Port: 5911
      Display: :11
      Password: l7IdD9I0

    This desktop session is not directly accessible from outside of your
    cluster as it is running on a machine that only provides internal
    cluster access.  In order to access your desktop session you will need
    to perform port forwarding using 'ssh':

      ssh -L 5911:10.10.1.1:5911 te1st@

    Once the ssh connection has been established, depending on your
    client, you can connect to the session using one of:

      vnc://te1st:l7IdD9I0@localhost:5911
      localhost:5911
      localhost:11

    If, when connecting, you receive a warning as follows, try again with
    a different port number, e.g. 5912, 5913 etc.:

      channel_setup_fwd_listener_tcpip: cannot listen to port: 5911

    If prompted, you should supply the following password: l7IdD9I0

.. tip::
    
    Take note of the lines which have been highlighted above: 
      * a port number, (**5911**), 
      * an ``ssh`` command you run on your **local machine** which connects the VNC session to your local machine,
      * a temporary VNC password (**l7IdD9I0**) which is valid only for your current VNC session.

Leave that terminal running. And, open another local terminal (ex. Windows PowerShell) 
entering the provided ``ssh`` command including cluster hostname after the @ sign. If prompted for password, enter your university account password (**not** the flight generated temporary VNC password which is valid only for the current VNC session). 

For example:

.. code-block:: bash

    ssh -L 5911:10.10.1.1:5911 te1st@stanage.shef.ac.uk

This step will set up local port forwarding to the remote host (Stanage). 

On your local machine start the 'VNC Viewer' program that comes with TigerVNC (this is called ``vncviewer`` on Linux).  You should then see a dialog box like this:

.. caution:: 
    
    Do not enter your normal university account password, use the temporary VNC password which was given in the ``flight desktop show`` command output.

.. image:: /images/vncviewer_dialog.png

Using the previously given port number, enter the connection details into the TigerVNC dialog, for example: 

.. code-block:: 

    localhost:5911

Click *Connect*, you will then be prompted for the temporary VNC password.


You should now see a desktop within a window, as below. This desktop is running within the interactive session
we requested on Stanage.

.. image:: /images/flight_desktop_session.png

You can click *close* on the error dialog. Then open a terminal at the bottom of the screen which will open inside the interactive session you first requested. 

When you are finished, close VNC Viewer then return to the terminal within which you started ``Flight Desktop`` and log out or continue with other tasks.

Example
^^^^^^^
An example, starting a MATLAB GUI in TigerVNC Viewer by entering the following commands into the terminal

.. code-block:: 

  $ module load MATLAB/2023b
  $ matlab

.. _trouble_flight:

Troubleshooting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You're seeing a "missing prerequisites": error message:
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

.. code-block::

    Desktop type xfce has missing prerequisites:

    * Reprostory: EPEL
    Before this desktop type can be used, it must be prepared by your
    cluster administrator using the 'prepare' command, i.e.:

      flight desktop prepare xfce

In most cases, this can be resolved using the following command:

.. code-block:: 

    mv ~/.local/share/flight/desktop ~/.local/share/flight/desktop_bk

The GUI is slow or unresponsive:
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
