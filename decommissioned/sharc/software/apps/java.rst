After connecting to ShARC (see :ref:`ssh`), start an interactive session with the `qrsh` or `qrshx` command.

Java can be activated using one of the following module files ::

        module load apps/java/17.0.4/binary
        module load apps/java/13.0.2/binary
        module load apps/java/11.0.2/binary
        module load apps/java/jdk1.8.0_102/binary 

Check that you have the version you expect. First, the runtime ::

    $ java -version

    openjdk version "17.0.4" 2022-07-19
    OpenJDK Runtime Environment Temurin-17.0.4+8 (build 17.0.4+8)
    OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Temurin-17.0.4+8 (build 17.0.4+8, mixed mode, sharing)


Now, the compiler ::

    $ javac -version

    javac 17.0.4
