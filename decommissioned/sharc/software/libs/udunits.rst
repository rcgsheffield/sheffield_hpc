The UDUNITS package supports units of physical quantities. 
Its C library provides for arithmetic manipulation of units and for conversion 
of numeric values between compatible units. The package contains an extensive unit database, 
which is in XML format and user-extendable. The package also contains a command-line utility 
for investigating units and converting values.

.. caution::

        UDUNITS is typically loaded as an external dependency for R. Please ensure you select the matching 
        GCC compiler versions of your version of R and the UDUNITS libraries.
