NAG Fortran Library (Serial)
============================

Produced by experts for use in a variety of applications, the NAG Fortran Library has a global reputation for its excellence and, with hundreds of fully documented and tested routines, is the largest collection of mathematical and statistical algorithms available.

This is the serial (1 CPU core) version of the NAG Fortran Library. For many routines, you may find it beneficial to use the parallel version of the library.

Usage
-----
There are several versions of the NAG Fortran Library available. The one you choose depends on which compiler you are using. As with many libraries installed on the system, NAG libraries are made available via ``module`` commands which are only available once you have started a ``qrsh`` or ``qsh`` session.

In addition to loading a module for the library, you will usually need to load a module for the compiler you are using.

**NAG for Intel Fortran**

Use the following command to make Mark 25 of the serial (1 CPU core) version of the NAG Fortran Library for Intel compilers available ::

    module load libs/intel/15/NAG/fll6i25dcl

Once you have ensured that you have loaded the module for the :ref:`Intel Compilers` you can compile your NAG program using ::

    ifort your_code.f90 -lnag_mkl -o your_code.exe

which links to a version of the NAG library that's linked against the high performance Intel MKL (which provides high-performance versions of the BLAS and LAPACK libraries). Alternatively, you can compile using ::

    ifort your_code.f90 -lnag_nag -o your_code.exe

Which is linked against a reference version of BLAS and LAPACK. If you are in any doubt as to which to choose, we suggest that you use ``-lnag_mkl``

Running NAG's example programs
------------------------------
Most of NAG's routines come with example programs that show how to use them. When you use the ``module`` command to load a version of the NAG library, the script ``nag_example`` becomes available. Providing this script wth the name of the NAG routine you are interested in will copy, compile and run the example program for that routine into your current working directory.

For example, here is an example output for the NAG routine ``a00aaf`` which identifies the version of the NAG library you are using. If you try this yourself, the output you get will vary according to which version of the NAG library you are using ::

  nag_example a00aaf

If you have loaded the ``module`` for fll6i25dcl this will give the following output ::

  Copying a00aafe.f90 to current directory
  cp /usr/local/packages6/libs/intel/15/NAG/fll6i25dcl/examples/source/a00aafe.f90 .

  Compiling and linking a00aafe.f90 to produce executable a00aafe.exe
  ifort -I/usr/local/packages6/libs/intel/15/NAG/fll6i25dcl/nag_interface_blocks a00aafe.f90 /usr/local/packages6/libs/intel/15/NAG/fll6i25dcl/lib/libnag_nag.a -o a00aafe.exe

  Running a00aafe.exe
  ./a00aafe.exe > a00aafe.r
