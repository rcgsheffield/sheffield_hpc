ShARC Decommissioned
---------------------
- As of November 30th, we have officially decommissioned our oldest High-Performance Computing (HPC) cluster, ShARC. For reference, we have archived ShARC's documentation :ref:`here <decommissioned>`.  
- Support remains available for users needing assistance transitioning to Stanage and Bessemer. You can access support through 
	- The `courses <https://sites.google.com/sheffield.ac.uk/research-training/>`_ we offer 
	- Join our drop-in sessions by signing up through the Google Form included in our weekly email that advertises these sessions.
	- Or by reaching out via email to ``researchcomputing@sheffield.ac.uk``  with your query. 
- A huge thanks to the members of the team who contributed towards its creation in the early days and for the ones who saw it through to its decommissioning. We plan to ship it to the `Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute` in Kyiv, so that it can have a second life supporting researchers.

GPU Benchmarks
--------------------
- At the beginning of the academic year, we benchmarked the performance of NVIDIA H100 GPUs on Stanage and shared our discoveries, available `here <https://notesrcg.blogspot.com/2023/08/Stanage-HPC-new-h100-gpus-available-benchmarking.html>`_ . Our findings highlighted how different workloads benefit from different GPUs. This led us to more recently investigating NVIDIA L40 GPUs as a potential addition to our GPU offerings. Our colleagues, Farhad Allian and Peter Heywood, detailed their findings in the following `blog post <https://notesrcg.blogspot.com/2023/12/blog-post.html>`_ in November. 

Recent HPC documentation updates:
