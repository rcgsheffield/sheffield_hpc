Mathematica is a technical computing environment and programming language with strong symbolic and numerical abilities.

Single Core Interactive Usage
-----------------------------
After connecting to Bessemer (see :ref:`ssh`),  start an interactive session with ``srun --pty bash -i``.

Mathematica can be loaded with ::

        module load MATHEMATICA/12.0.0/binary

Mathematica can then be started with the ``mathematica`` command ::

        mathematica

Multicore Interactive Usage
---------------------------
Mathematica has extensive parallel functionality. To use it, you should request a parallel interactive session. For example, to request 2 cores ::

    srun -c="2" --pty bash -i

Load and launch Mathematica ::

    module load MATHEMATICA/12.0.0/binary
    mathematica

In Mathematica, time how long it takes to calculate the first 20 million primes on 1 CPU core ::

    AbsoluteTiming[primelist = Table[Prime[k], {k, 1, 20000000}];]

Now, let's launch 2 ParallelKernels and redo the calculation in parallel ::

    LaunchKernels[2]
    AbsoluteTiming[primelist =
    ParallelTable[Prime[k], {k, 1, 20000000},
    Method -> "CoarsestGrained"];]

This illustrates a couple of points:-

* You should always request the same number of kernels as you requested in your ``srun -c="2" --pty bash -i`` command (in this case, 2).
* N kernels doesn't always translate to N times faster.

Batch Submission
----------------
Unfortunately, it is not possible to run Mathematica notebook .nb files directly in batch.  Instead, you need to create a simple text file that contains all of the Mathematica commands you want to execute.  Typically, such files are given the extension .m.  Letâ€™s run the following simple Mathematica script as a batch job. ::

  (*Find out what version of Mathematica this machine is running*)
  Print["Mathematica version is " <> $Version]

  (*Find out the name of the machine we are running on*)
  Print["The machine name is " <> $MachineName]

  (*Do a calculation*)
  Print["The result of the integral is "]
  Print [ Integrate[Sin[x]^2, x]]

Copy and paste the above into a text file called `very_simple_mathematica.m`

An example batch submission script for this file is ::

  #!/bin/bash
  # Request 4 gigabytes of real memory
  #SBATCH --mem=4000
  #SBATCH --mail-user=a.person@sheffield.ac.uk
  #SBATCH --mail-type=ALL
  module load MATHEMATICA/12.0.0/binary

  math -script very_simple_mathematica.m

Copy and paste the above into a file called `run_job.sh` and submit with ::

  sbatch run_job.sh

Once the job has successfully completed, the output will be in a file named like `slurm-1503687.out`. The number at the end refers to the job-ID given to this job by the system and will be different for you. The contents of this file is ::

  more slurm-1503687.out

  Mathematica version is 12.0.0 for Linux x86 (64-bit) (April 7, 2019)
  The machine name is bessemer-node017
  The result of the integral is 
  x/2 - Sin[2*x]/4

Installation notes
------------------
These are primarily for administrators of the system. 
Download the Mathematica package, Mathematica_12.0.0_LINUX.sh, from Wolfram.

**For Version 12.0.0** ::

    mkdir -p /usr/local/packages/live/noeb/MATHEMATICA/12.0.0/binary
    chmod +x ./Mathematica_12.0.0_LINUX.sh
    ./Mathematica_12.0.0_LINUX.sh

The installer is interactive. Here's the session output ::

  Now installing...

  Installation complete.


Remove the ``playerpass`` file ::

  rm /usr/local/packages/live/noeb/MATHEMATICA/12.0.0/binary/Configuration/Licensing/playerpass

Install the University network license ``mathpass`` file at ``/usr/local/packages/live/noeb/MATHEMATICA/12.0.0/binary/Configuration/Licensing``. Mathpass contains the following ::

  !mathlm.sheffield.ac.uk

The module file is
