Libsndfile is a C library for reading and writing files containing sampled sound
(such as MS Windows WAV and the Apple/SGI AIFF format)
through one standard library interface.
It is released in source code format under the GNU Lesser General Public License (GPL). 

It was designed to handle both little-endian (such as WAV) and big-endian (such as AIFF) data,
and to compile and run correctly on little-endian (such as Intel and DEC/Compaq Alpha) processor systems
as well as big-endian processor systems

libsndfile has the following main features:

* Ability to read and write a large number of file formats.
* A simple, elegant and easy to use Applications Programming Interface.
* Usable on Unix, Win32, MacOS and others.
* On the fly format conversion, including endian-ness swapping, type conversion and bitwidth scaling.
* Optional normalisation when reading floating point data from files containing integer data.
* Ability to open files in read/write mode.
* The ability to write the file header without closing the file (only on files open for write or read/write).
* Ability to query the library about all supported formats and retrieve text strings describing each format. 

Usage
