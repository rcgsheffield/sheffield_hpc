The Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) is a computer program for atomic scale materials modelling, e.g. electronic structure calculations and quantum-mechanical molecular dynamics, from first principles.

Usage
-----

VASP 5.4.1 can be activated using the module file: ::

    module load apps/vasp/5.4.1.05Feb16/intel-17.0.0-openmpi-2.0.1

VASP 5.4.4 can be activated using the module file: ::

    module load apps/vasp/5.4.4.pl2/intel-17.0.0-openmpi-2.0.1

The VASP executables are ``vasp_std``, ``vasp_gam`` and ``vasp_ncl``.

.. important::

    Only licensed users of VASP are entitled to use the code; refer to VASP's website for license details: https://www.vasp.at/sign_in/registration_form/ . Access to VASP on ShARC is restricted to members of the unix group ``vasp``.
    To be added to this group, please contact ``research-it@sheffield.ac.uk`` and provide evidence of your eligibility to use VASP.


Pseudopotential files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

VASP Pseudopotentials can be found in the ``$VASP_ROOT`` directory in versioned ``potpaw`` sub-directories after loading the module, e.g. :

.. code-block:: console

    $ module load apps/vasp/5.4.4.pl2/intel-17.0.0-openmpi-2.0.1
    $ ls $VASP_ROOT
    potpaw_LDA  potpaw_PBE  vasp.5.4.4.pl2

Batch jobs
----------

Users are encouraged to write their own batch submission scripts. The following is an example batch submission script, ``my_job.sh``, to run ``vasp_std`` and which is submitted to the queue with the command ``qsub my_job.sh``. ::

    #!/bin/bash
    #$ -cwd
    #$ -l h_rt=00:30:00
    #$ -l rmem=2G
    #$ -pe mpi 4

    module load apps/vasp/5.4.4.pl2/intel-17.0.0-openmpi-2.0.1

    mpirun -np $NSLOTS vasp_std

The script requests 4 cores using the Open MPI parallel environment ``mpi`` with a runtime of 30 mins and 2 GB of real memory per core.


Installation notes
------------------

Module files have been modified to include the VASP Pseudopotentials directory environment variables. Installations have also been modified and had
correctly versioned Pseudopotentials folders symlinked into their ``$VASP_ROOT`` directory from the main Pseudopotentials storage directory as indicated by ``$PSEUDOPOTENTIAL_DIR``.

VASP Pseudopotential files downloaded from the VASP portal and/or license holders can provide future versions as these are provided under the same license as the program.

VASP 5.4.4.pl2 was installed using the
:download:`install_vasp.sh </decommissioned/sharc/software/install_scripts/apps/vasp/5.4.4.pl2/intel-17.0.0-openmpi-2.0.1/install_vasp.sh>` script;
the module file is
:download:`/usr/local/modulefiles/apps/vasp/5.4.4.pl2/intel-17.0.0-openmpi-2.0.1 </decommissioned/sharc/software/modulefiles/apps/vasp/5.4.4.pl2/intel-17.0.0-openmpi-2.0.1>`.

VASP 5.4.1 (05Feb16) was installed using the
:download:`install_vasp.sh </decommissioned/sharc/software/install_scripts/apps/vasp/5.4.1.05Feb16/intel-17.0.0-openmpi-2.0.1/install_vasp.sh>` script;
the module file is
:download:`/usr/local/modulefiles/apps/vasp/5.4.1.05Feb16/intel-17.0.0-openmpi-2.0.1 </decommissioned/sharc/software/modulefiles/apps/vasp/5.4.1.05Feb16/intel-17.0.0-openmpi-2.0.1>`.

The VASP 5.4.1 installation was tested by running a batch job using the ``my_job.sh`` batch script above with the input for the "O atom" example (https://www.vasp.at/wiki/index.php/O_atom) from the online VASP tutorials (https://www.vasp.at/wiki/index.php/Category:Tutorials).
