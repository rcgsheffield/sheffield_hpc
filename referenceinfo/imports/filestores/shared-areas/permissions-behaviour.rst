Permissions behaviour
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You may encounter strange permissions issues when running programs on HPC against the ``/shared`` areas 
e.g. ``chmod +x /shared/mygroup1/myprogram.sh`` fails.
Here we try to explain why.

Behind the scenes, the file server that provides this shared storage manages permissions using 
Windows-style `ACLs <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_control_list>`_ 
(which can be set by area owners via the `Research Storage management web interface <https://sheffield.ac.uk/storage/>`__.
However, the filesystem is mounted on a Linux cluster using NFSv4 so the file server therefore requires 
a means for mapping Windows-style permissions to Linux ones.  
An effect of this is that the Linux `mode bits <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modes_(Unix)>`_ for files/directories under ``/shared`` on the HPC systems
are not always to be believed: 
the output of ``ls -l somefile.sh`` may indicate that a file is readable/writable/executable when 
the ACLs are what really determine access permissions.  
Most applications have robust ways of checking for properties such as executability but 
some applications can cause problems when accessing files/directories on ``/shared`` by naively checking permissions just using Linux mode bits:

* `which <http://linux.die.net/man/1/which>`_: 
  a directory under ``/shared`` may be on your path and 
  you may be able to run a contained executable without prefixing it with a absolute/relative directory 
  but ``which`` may fail to find that executable.
* Perl: scripts that check for executability of files on ``/shared`` using ``-x`` may fail 
  unless Perl is explicitly told to test for file permissions in a more thorough way 
  (see the mention of ``use filetest 'access'`` `here <http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/-X.html>`_).
* git: may complain that permissions have changed if 
  a repository is simply moved to ``/shared/someplace`` from elsewhere on Bessemer/ShARC. 
  As a workaround you can tell git to not to track Linux permissions for a single repository using 
  ``git config core.filemode false`` or 
  for all repositories using ``git config --global core.filemode false``.

**Changing how attempts to change permissions are handled**: each ``/shared`` area can be configured so that

#. Attempts to change file/directory mode bits fail (e.g. ``chmod +x /shared/mygroup1/myprogram.sh`` fails) (**default configuration per area**) **or**
#. Attempts to change file/directory mode bits appear to succeed (e.g. ``chmod +x /shared/mygroup1/myprogram.sh`` does not fail but also does not actually change any permissions on the underlying file server) (**alternative configuration per area**)

If you would like to switch to using the second way of handling permissions for a particular ``/shared/`` area then
the Owner of this area should make a request via the Helpdesk.
