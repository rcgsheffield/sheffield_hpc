This is the manual for all the High Performance Computing (HPC) services
provided at the University of Sheffield.

High Performance Computing at Sheffield
---------------------------------------

The Research Computing Group manages two High Performance Computing (HPC)
systems at Sheffield, the **Iceberg** cluster and the new **ShARC** cluster.
These systems are going to both be available for the next few years, however,
eventually Iceberg will be retired. For all the information on the two clusters
see:

* :ref:`iceberg` - Sheffield's current HPC service
* :ref:`sharc` - Sheffield's new HPC Service (Not yet ready for users)

Both the clusters are designed to be similar enough to one another so that if
you are familiar with one you will be able to use both.

Research Computing Team
-----------------------

The research computing team are the team responsible for the iceberg service, as well as all other aspects of research computing.
If you require support with iceberg, training or software for your workstations, the research computing team would be happy to help.
Take a look at the `Research Computing <https://www.shef.ac.uk/cics/research>`_ website or email `research-it@sheffield.ac.uk <research-it@sheffield.ac.uk>`_.

Research Software Engineering Team
----------------------------------

The Sheffield Research Software Engineering Team is an academically led group that collaborates closely with CiCS.
They can assist with code optimisation, training and all aspects of High Performance Computing including GPU computing along with local, national, regional and cloud computing services.
