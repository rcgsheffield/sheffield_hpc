Each PI at the University is entitled to request a `free 10 TB storage area for sharing data with their group and collaborators <https://sheffield.ac.uk/it-services/research-storage/using-research-storage>`__.
The capacity per area can be extended and additional shared areas can be purchased (both at a cost).

After one of these project storage areas has been requested/purchased it can be accessed in two ways:

* as a Windows-style (SMB) file share on machines other than ShARC, Bessemer and Stanage using ``\\uosfstore.shef.ac.uk\shared\``;
* as a subdirectory of ``/shared`` on ShARC, Bessemer and Stanage (you need to **explicitly request HPC access when you order storage from IT Services**).
