Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) determines the effect of your
variants (SNPs, insertions, deletions, CNVs or structural variants) on genes,
transcripts, and protein sequence, as well as regulatory regions.
Includes EnsEMBL-XS, which provides pre-compiled replacements for frequently
used routines in VEP.
