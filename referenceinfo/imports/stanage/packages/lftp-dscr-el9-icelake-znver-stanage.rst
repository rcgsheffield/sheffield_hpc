LFTP is a sophisticated ftp/http client, and a file transfer program supporting
a number of network protocols. Like BASH, it has job control and uses the readline library for
input. It has bookmarks, a built-in mirror command, and can transfer several files in parallel.
It was designed with reliability in mind.
