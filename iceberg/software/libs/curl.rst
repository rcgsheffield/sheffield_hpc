Usage
-----
There is a default version of curl available on the system but it is rather old ::

    curl-config --version

gives the result ::

    libcurl 7.19.7

Version 7.19.7 was released in November 2009!

A newer version of the library is available via the module system. To make it available ::

    module load libs/gcc/4.4.7/curl/7.47.1

The `curl-config` command will now report the newer version ::

    curl-config --version

Should result in ::

    libcurl 7.47.1

Documentation

Standard `man` pages are available ::
