Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL)
==========================================

.. sidebar:: GDAL

   :Latest version: 3.2.1,3.3.2
   :URL: http://www.gdal.org/

GDAL is a library used by many Geographic Information Systems (GIS) packages for converting 
between many different raster and vector GIS data formats.  It also includes command-line 
utilities for data translation and processing.  It is released under an an X/MIT style Open 
Source license by the `Open Source Geospatial Foundation <http://www.osgeo.org/>`_.

-------

Usage
-----

Load by running one of the following ::

    module load GDAL/3.2.1-foss-2020b
    module load GDAL/3.3.2-foss-2021b

This will:

* add several GDAL programs to your ``PATH`` environment variable
* allow other programs to make use of (dynamically link against) the GDAL library
* activate the modules associated with the specific :ref:`foss toolchain <stanage_eb_toolchains>`

.. include:: /referenceinfo/imports/stanage/openmpi_4.1.1_import.rst

You can run ``gdal-config --version`` to test that you are running the required version ::

    $ gdal-config --version
    3.3.2

Some commonly used command-line programs that GDAL provides are:

* ``gdaladdo``
* ``gdalbuildvrt``
* ``gdal-config``
* ``gdal_contour``
* ``gdaldem``
* ``gdalenhance``
* ``gdal_grid``
* ``gdalinfo``
* ``gdallocationinfo``
* ``gdalmanage``
* ``gdal_rasterize``
* ``gdalserver``
* ``gdalsrsinfo``
* ``gdaltindex``
* ``gdaltransform``
* ``gdal_translate``
* ``gdalwarp``
* ``nearblack``
* ``ogr2ogr``
* ``ogrinfo``
* ``ogrlineref``
* ``ogrtindex``
* ``testepsg``

The ``gdal...`` utilities are mostly for processing raster GIS data formats, 
whilst the ``ogr...`` utilities are for processing vector GIS data formats.
