CPU cache
---------

 CPU cache refers to smaller, faster memory which is located on the CPU itself. CPUs usually have multiple caches at different "levels" with higher levels able to store larger amounts of data but going slower. 
 These caches are used to speed up computation by keeping the most frequently accessed data located in faster memory close to the CPU and its cores.
