CUDA (formerly Compute Unified Device Architecture) is a parallel
computing platform and programming model created by NVIDIA and implemented by the
graphics processing units (GPUs) that they produce. CUDA gives developers access
to the virtual instruction set and memory of the parallel computational elements in CUDA GPUs.
