Instruction sets
----------------

 Instruction sets or instruction set architecture are the part of the computer architecture 
 that provide the commands or instructions that a processor can execute.  |br|
 
.. tip::

    An example of an instruction could be the ADD or SUBTRACT instructions which follow their 
    namesake operation on numbers.

    Examples of instruction sets could include general sets such as x86 (common to 32bit and 64 bit processors) or x64 (common to 64bit processors) but can also be very specific such as AES-NI which is designed to specifically accelerate cryptographic algorithms.
