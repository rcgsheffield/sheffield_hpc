Rosetta is a comprehensive software suite for modeling macromolecular structures. As a flexible, multi-purpose application, 
it includes tools for structure prediction, design, and remodeling of proteins and nucleic acids. Since 1998, 
Rosetta web servers have run billions of structure prediction and protein design simulations, and billions or trillions 
more have been run on supercomputer clusters.

Usage
-----

Rosetta can be activated by loading the module:

.. code-block ::
