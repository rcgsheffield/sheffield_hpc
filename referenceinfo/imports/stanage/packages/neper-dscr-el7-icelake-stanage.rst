Neper is a free / open source software package for polycrystal generation and meshing. It can be used to
generate polycrystals with a wide variety of morphological properties, from very simple morphologies (simple tessellations,
grain-growth microstructures, â€¦) to complex, multiphase or multiscale microstructures that involve grain subdivisions.
The resulting tessellations can be meshed into high-quality meshes suitable for finite-element simulations.
