This is the documentation for Bessemer, one of the University of Sheffield's High Performance Computing clusters. Bessemer is a 'capacity' cluster designed 
to run compute jobs which will fit on a single node.
Bessemer can support jobs requiring up to 40 cores per job; for larger jobs please use :ref:`stanage`, which has 64 cores in standard non-GPU nodes and supports multi-node jobs
