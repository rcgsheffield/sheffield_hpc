TOTP stands for **Time-based One-Time Passwords** and is a common form of two factor authentication (2FA). 
Unique numeric codes are generated with an algorithm which uses the current time and a secret seed key as inputs. 
The time-based codes are available offline and increase account security when used as a second factor.

TOTP is also known as token based authentication, software tokens, or soft tokens. Mobile phone based authentication apps like DUO, Authy and Google Authenticator support the TOTP standard.
