General Computer Architecture Quick Start 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This page details the parts of a modern computer and their connectivity that 
we need to understand to apply to running jobs on a HPC cluster.

.. important::

    These descriptions are drastically simplified in order to give a basic 
    overview which users can use to better understand requesting cluster 
    resources.

Computer architecture as a concept
**********************************

Before discussing aspects of "computer architecture" we must first define what this means. In short:

    Computer architecture refers to how a computer system is designed and what technologies 
    it is compatible with.

This can also be roughly subdivided into, system (physical) design, instruction set architecture and 
microarchitecture. 

.. tip::

    Further info on these subdivisions can be found at the following link:

Physical architecture
*********************

Physical architecture refers to the real physical components and structures used by computers.
