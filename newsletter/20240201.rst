=================

Welcome back! We're delighted to have you back with us and hope everyone enjoyed a wonderful break. As we step into the new year, some of us may encounter new technical challenges or wish to explore new options to enhance your existing workflows, remember, our team is here to support you. Whether it's through code clinics, drop-in sessions, our ticketing system, seminars, or even personalized department visits upon request. Feel free to reach out to us via our email email ``researchcomputing@sheffield.ac.uk``.

For those wanting to learn new skills like using source control with git, we encourage you to explore our upcoming training sessions below. The training team will run courses in data science, machine learning, high-performance computing, and programming, all organized by IT Services.

We also have 2 part time vacancies on the horizon. The details for these are listed in the vacancies section and once the recruitment period is live, we will send an email to notify potential candidates.

GPU News
--------
- The Stanage H100 GPU drivers have been updated, addressing a numerical inaccuracy bug that was reported back in september.
- The GPU drivers in Bessemer were also updated.
- With the new drivers in place, we will soon start supporting CUDA 12.2. You will be notified once this is done in an email and should also feature in next months newsletter.


Recent HPC documentation updates:
---------------------------------
- We have taken the first steps into making the search function on the HPC documentation more accurate. Going into the documentation site , you will notice the new search engine and over time we are going to be working in further optimising the search function to make it more accurate.
- References to ShARC will be removed from the documentation and only the:ref:`Decommissioned Clusters <decommissioned>` section should have any reference to it.
- The parallel computing section will also be updated this month.

We work very hard on the documentation and any feedback or criticism helps us make them more clear and easy to read for example the search engine change was based on user feedback, so please feel free to get intouch.

The following software are now available on Stanage:
