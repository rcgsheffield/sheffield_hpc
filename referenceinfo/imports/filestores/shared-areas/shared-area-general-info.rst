Each PI at the University is entitled to request a `free 10 TB storage area for sharing data with their group and collaborators <https://sheffield.ac.uk/it-services/research-storage/using-research-storage>`__.
The capacity per area can be extended and additional shared areas can be purchased (both at a cost).

After one of these project storage areas has been requested/purchased it can be accessed in two ways:

* as a Windows-style (SMB) file share on machines other than ShARC, Bessemer and Stanage using ``\\uosfstore.shef.ac.uk\shared\``;
* as a subdirectory of ``/shared`` on ShARC, Bessemer and Stanage (you need to **explicitly request HPC access when you order storage from IT Services**).


.. danger:: 

    The High Performance Computing service :underline-bold:`must not be used to store or process any restricted or sensitive data.` Shared areas with this type of data
    are not permitted to be made available on the clusters.
    
    Research shared storage areas may already contain sensitive data, or may contain sensitive data stored by colleagues you are not aware of.
    Before requesting an area to be made available on the HPC clusters, you must ensure that they do not and will not contain any sensitive 
    data for the life time of the area.
