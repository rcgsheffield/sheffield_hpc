The UDUNITS package supports units of physical quantities. 
Its C library provides for arithmetic manipulation of units and for conversion 
of numeric values between compatible units. The package contains an extensive unit database, 
which is in XML format and user-extendable. The package also contains a command-line utility 
for investigating units and converting values.

.. caution::

        UDUNITS is typically loaded as an external dependency for R. Please ensure you select the matching 
        GCC compiler versions of your version of R and the UDUNITS libraries.

udunits was installed using Easybuild 4.7.0, build details can be found in ``$EBROOTGMP/easybuild`` with the module loaded.

Testing
-------

    1. load Module

    2. Run “udunits2“

    3. For this test we convert 5km into miles, which produces the following results:

    .. code-block:: console
        
        You have: 5km
        You want: miles
        5 km = 3.10686 miles
        x/miles = 0.621371*(x/km)
